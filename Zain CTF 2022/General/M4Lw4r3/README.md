## Description

A type of malware that uses native legitimate tools built into the system to execute malicious activities

## Detailed solution

It's a **fileless malware** 

Fileless malware is a type of malicious activity that uses native, legitimate tools built into a system to execute a cyber attack. Unlike traditional malware, fileless malware does not require an attacker to install any code on a target’s system, making it hard to detect.

This fileless technique of using native tools to conduct a malicious attack is called “living off the land.”
