Starting by looking at the picture from google drive link

We can see the Freedom of the Seas a cruise ship operated by Royal Caribbean International.

Checking article https://www.cruisecritic.com/news/5163/ 

Royal Caribbeanâ€™s recently-revitalized Freedom of the Seas has returned to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where it operates cruises to the Southern Caribbean.  

So our place is in the Southern Caribbean. I notice the rum therapy place so i searched for ```rum therapy Southern Caribbean``` and check google images 

I found the place "Rum Therapy Bar and Treatment Center" at Castries, St. Lucia

Search around for a brewing company, i found "Antillia Brewing Company Bar" which is close to the first bar
