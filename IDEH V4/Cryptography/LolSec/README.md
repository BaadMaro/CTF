## Detailed solution

If we search for "HAI 1.2", we will find that it's used in a language called LOLCODE https://github.com/justinmeza/lolcode-spec/blob/master/v1.2/lolcode-spec-v1.2.md 

- HAI 1.2 : The version used which is 1.2
- VISIBLE : to print a message
- I HAS A `variable name` ITZ `value` : to declare a variable with name and value
- BTW [MESSAGE] : to put a message 

You can use a compiler to play with the language https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_lolcode_online.php

From the BTW message part, we understand that the flag has the variable name and we should use underscore between parts

For the variables, the value represent the order (in binary) that we should use.

We just need to put varibales name using the order and seprate by underscore 

## Flag

```
IDEH{L0L_N3V3R_KN3W_TH1S}
```
