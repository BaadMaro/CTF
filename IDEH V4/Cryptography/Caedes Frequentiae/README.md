## Description

Hey officers, I was investigating a murder case and found some messages on the victim's phone, the first one is: "O QD ZIT WTLZ-FQZXKTR EKTQZXKT OF ZIT VGKSR, QFR NTZ O IQCT QSKTQRN AOSSTR ZIKTT DTF, QFR GY ZITLT ZIKTT ZVG VTKT HKOTLZL". I believe the victim and the receiver were using some kind of key to keep their communication secure and understandble by no one by them. The last message was this one, it was written as a draft and not sent though: "WORK_OL_ZIT_DXKRTKTK" I believe the last message holds some useful information for us, can you help me please?
